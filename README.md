# Expense-tracker
An application to track income and expenses in a month

## How the Application was built
The app was built using javaScript class. The application was built for me to understand how classes work better. 

## Current State of the application 
![image of the application](https://github.com/davieoba/Expense-tracker/blob/main/image1.png)

## How to use the application 
* The user selects + / -. The (+) indicates income while the (-) indicates expenses. 
* Then the user proceeds to enter the description for the respective income / expense. 
* After which the amount is added, if the user presses enter on the keyboard the data is immediately displayed under the income / expense tab. 
* If the user makes a mistake the data can be deleted by hovering over the data and selecting the delete icon. 
* **Note**: The icons will not show if you are not running the app on a live server. To run locally you can make use of live-server from npm. 



## Features to add to the project
- [ ] connect it to a backend service so that a user can have thier personal account.
- [ ] Save the data to a Database 
- [ ] Implement History such that a user can view previous account records stored
- [ ] Implement Login for authentication

#### Contribution in form of advice to make the application better or features that can be added to the application would be much appreciated :confetti_ball: :confetti_ball: :confetti_ball:
